Assignment 3

Sergei and Stephanie were given a client scenerio in which we had to develope a Architecture Decision Record (ADR).

Scenerio:

You are a team responsible for developing a new mobile app for a retail company. The app will allow customers to browse and purchase products, view their order history, and track the status of their deliveries. Additionally, the app will have a loyalty program feature, where customers can earn and redeem points for discounts on future purchases. The following requirements must be considered:

1.	The retail company wants the app to support offline mode, allowing customers to browse products and view their order history even when they are not connected to the internet. The app should sync data with the    
server once an internet connection is available.

2.	The retail company wants to send push notifications to customers to notify them about order updates, new product arrivals, and exclusive offers. The app should integrate with a push notification service to 
handle the delivery of notifications.

3.	The app needs to integrate with various payment gateways to facilitate secure and convenient transactions for customers. The team should select and integrate a suitable payment gateway or a combination of 
gateways based on security, ease of use, and compatibility with the app's target platforms.

4.	The retail company wants to track user behavior, such as product views, purchases, and loyalty program interactions. The team should select an analytics tool or service that provides detailed insights and 
metrics to help improve the app's performance and user experience.

5.	The app will display product images, which may vary in size and resolution. To ensure optimal performance, the team needs to decide on an image storage solution and implement image optimization techniques such 
as caching, lazy loading, and compression.

6.	The retail company plans to expand its customer base internationally. The app should support multiple languages and adapt to various cultural preferences. The team needs to implement localization techniques and 
decide on the appropriate localization framework or libraries.
