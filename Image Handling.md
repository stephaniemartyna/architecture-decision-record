# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)
**Scenerio #1 - Mobile Retail App**
**Stephanie Martyna and Sergei Mochalov**
___
> This project involves developing a mobile app for a retail company, focusing on features like product browsing, purchasing, and a loyalty program. Key requirements include supporting offline mode for customers, integrating push notifications for order updates and offers, and implementing secure payment gateways. Additionally, the app will track user behavior, optimize image handling, and support multiple languages for international expansion.

# Image Handling

**Context**
We are in the process of selecting a content delivery and image handling provider for our mobile app project for a retail company. The app has specific requirements related to offline mode support, push notifications, payment gateways, analytics, localization, and image handling.

**Decision**
After a thorough evaluation of the two options, we have decided to select Cloudflare as our content delivery and image handling provider for the retail mobile app project. This decision is based on the following considerations, which take into account the specific project requirements:

**Rationale**

- **Offline Mode Support**: Cloudflare's robust content delivery network (CDN) and image optimization features are well-suited to support offline mode. It can efficiently cache and deliver content, including product images, to users even when they are not connected to the internet. When connectivity is restored, Cloudflare can seamlessly sync data with the server, ensuring a smooth offline and online experience for customers.

- **Localization**: The need for localization techniques and frameworks to support multiple languages and cultural preferences is a separate consideration from content delivery and image handling. We will decide on localization strategies and frameworks as part of the app's overall architecture.

- **Image Handling**: Cloudflare's image optimization features, including caching, lazy loading, and compression, align with our requirements to display product images of varying sizes and resolutions while ensuring optimal performance. These features will help minimize load times and enhance the user experience.

**Consequences**

By selecting Cloudflare as our content delivery and image handling provider, we anticipate the following consequences:

- Efficient support for offline mode, ensuring customers can browse products and view order history even without an internet connection.
- Reliable delivery of push notifications to keep customers informed about important updates and offers.
- Optimized image handling, including caching and compression, for improved app performance.
- Streamlined data synchronization with the server for a seamless offline-to-online experience.
